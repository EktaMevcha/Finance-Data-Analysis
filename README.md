# Finance-Data-Analysis
Finance Data Analyst Project (Python)
Project Overview:
Developed a comprehensive financial analysis pipeline using Python to analyze and forecast financial data.
The project involved working with large datasets to uncover trends, identify key financial metrics, and predict future financial performance.
Key Responsibilities:
Data Collection & Cleaning: Gathered data from multiple financial sources, including CSV files, SQL databases, and APIs. Performed data cleaning, transformation, and normalization using pandas and NumPy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted thorough EDA to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data. Used matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.
Financial Modeling: Created predictive models for revenue, expenses, and profit margins using machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and time-series analysis with libraries like scikit-learn and stats models.
Reporting & Visualization: Developed interactive dashboards using Plotly and Dash to present financial insights and forecasts to stakeholders. Also generated static reports using matplotlib and seaborn.
Automation: Automated the financial reporting process using Python scripts, reducing manual effort and ensuring timely delivery of reports.
Tools & Technologies: Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, stats models) -- Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn,- Data Sources: CSV, SQL, APIVersion Control: Git/GitHub  IDE: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
